# Yet Another Ticketing Bot
I made this bot primarily for BSMG (Beat Saber Modding Group), but if you find a use case for it, go ahead and use it :D.

The bot is a fully customizable and dynamic ticketing bot capable of handling anything.

# Running
You need to have a PostgreSQL database running and edit the .env according to your configuration.

After you're done, just write

```batch
yarn initiate
```

and your bot is running!
